## About

Coin and Conquest (C&C) is a brutal deck building card game that pairs 3-5 players against each other as medieval lords. It’s a cutthroat struggle to the top, so mind who you play with as feelings can get hurt. The game’s asymmetrical start does not lend itself to power gamers. For best results, the game should be approached with a light-hearted mercilessness. This is made easier by the fact that you can always say the odds were never stacked in your favor, and that game dynamics can change drastically with only one round of combat, well-timed card draw, or a deal (read: blackmailed agreement) between players.
### Inspiration
We were inspired by games such as [Dominion](https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion), [Loot](https://gamewright.com/product/Loot), [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/), [Catan](https://www.catan.com/) and others tabletop games. While Dominion was a pioneer of the deckbuilding genre, it lacks in player interaction. This led us to explore making a game that combined deckbuilding, negotiation, resource management, and territorial control. 


### Our Goals
* High player interaction
* Diverse deckbuilding opportunities
* 3 - 5 players
* Actually under 1.5 hours to play (many games highly underestimate their duration)
* Small box

### Results
The current game is still in Alpha testing so this is currently not a finished game but the results of our playtest have been promising.

## How to play
### Goal
Your goal when playing Coin and Conquest is to make the most of the territory(s) you control and build your kingdoms economy i.e your deck. The winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the game. Each territory a player controls is worth 4 points and certain other cards also have their point value in the top right corner.

### Territories
In C&C each player starts with 2 Territories and a deck of 10 cards. This is their inheritance, this is the foundation of their kingdom. but each kingdom does not have the same geography and therefore not the same access to resources. In C&C there are 4 territory types.

</p>
The land that you control will dictate much of what you can do with your kingdom. But if you feel constrained by the limits of your land don't worry you can always take someone else's.

*Territories are not just valuable for the resources they give you access to, they also give 4 points per territory.*

### Resources 
Resources are vital to your Kingdom and are used to buy Cards and pay for activated abilities.\
There are 5 resource types Food, Wood, Steel, Stone, and Gold. 4 of which can be extracted with labor from its corresponding territory.

- Field  = Food
- Forest = Wood
- Mine   = Steel
- Quarry = Stone

Gold the 5th resources can be made in a variety of way, The most basic of which is trading 4 of any resources with the Bank for one Gold.
Resources can be used to buy Cards and pay for activated abilities.

#### Standard 
Standard cards are marked with a blue name banner. These cards may be played at any time. The text on these cards takes effect immediately upon them being played in order from top to bottom. 

Once played standard cards remain in a player's play area until the clean up faze winter.

#### Attack 
Attack cards are marked by a red name banner. These cards may only be played during the combat phase and must be played on a territory infrastructure or contest card. (Attack cards are placed in the discard pile at the end of the combat phase slash attack cards remain in a players play area until winter (the clean up fees?)

#### Infrastructure 
Infrastructure cards are marked by a green name banner. Once played, unless otherwise stated, infrastructure cards remain in front of a player in their play area until the end of the game or until stolen by another player. Infrastructure cards often provide victory points and do so even if they are within a player's deck at the end of the game.
