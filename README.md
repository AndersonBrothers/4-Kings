## About

Four Kings is a brutal deck building card game that pairs 4-5 players against each other as medieval lords. It’s a cutthroat struggle to the top so mind who you play with, feelings can get hurt. The games asymmetrical start does not lend itself to power gamers. For the best results the game should be approached with a light-hearted seriousness. This is made easier by the fact you can always say the odds were stacked against you.
We were inspired by games such as [Dominion](https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion), [Loot](https://gamewright.com/product/Loot), [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/), [Catan](https://www.catan.com/) and others tabletop games. While Dominion was a pioner of the deckbuilding genre it lacks in player interaction. 

### Goals
* High player interaction
* Diverse deckbuilding opportunities
* 4 - 5 players
* Under 2 real hours to play
* Small box
